---Paroles---

[Couplet 1]
G           C
I love You, Lord
         F
Oh, Your mercy never fails me
        Am
All my days
     Dm                G
I've been held in Your hands
                       C
From the moment that I wake up
F              C
Until I lay my head
       Dm          G           C
I will sing of the goodness of God

[Refrain]
F                         C        
All my life You have been faithful
F                         C      G     
All my life You have been so, so good
F                           C        
With every breath that I am able
       Dm          G           C
I will sing of the goodness of God
