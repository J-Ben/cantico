[Couplet 1]
    G                C           G
Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
    Em               D           G
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
    C                G           Em
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
    G                D           G
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light

[Couplet 2]
    G                C           G
Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word
    Em               D           G
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord
    C                G           Em
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son
    G                D           G
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one

[Couplet 3]
    G                C           G
Be Thou my battle shield, sword for the fight
    Em               D           G
Be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight
    C                G           Em
Thou my soul's shelter, Thou my high tower
    G                D           G
Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power

[Couplet 4]
    G                C           G
Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
    Em               D           G
Thou mine inheritance, now and always
    C                G           Em
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
    G                D           G
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art

[Couplet 5]
    G                C           G
High King of heaven, my victory won
    Em               D           G
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun
    C                G           Em
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall
    G                D           G
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all
