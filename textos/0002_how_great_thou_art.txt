O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder

Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made

[Couplet 2]
    G                C             G
When through the woods and forest glades I wander
    G              D             G
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
    G              C              G
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
    G               D            G
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze

How great Thou art, how great Thou art

How great Thou art, how great Thou art

    G               C              G
And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
    G               D              G
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
    G              C              G
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing
    G             D              G
He bled and died to take away my sin

How great Thou art, how great Thou art
     G              C              G
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee
     Am             D              G
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

[Couplet 4]
    G                C              G
When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
    G               D             G
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
    G              C              G
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
    G             D              G
And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art

How great Thou art, how great Thou art
